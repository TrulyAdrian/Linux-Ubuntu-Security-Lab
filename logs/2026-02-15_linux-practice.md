# Installation - Feb 15, 2026 (Day 0)

## What I Did Today
I installed ubuntu in vmware esxi using a desktop and a laptop so I am ready to learn Linux with it

## What I Learned
- I learned what an iso file is used for when installing operating systems
- How virtual machines actually run likle when using them 
- his helped me get hands on knowledge of a Linux startup and how to isntall any os

## Problems & Solutions
Took hours to figure out how to install the ubunu and then it froze and had to restart - figured out I had to increase the 
avaiable memory to allow the installation to complete

## Next Time
Next time I want to be able to set up users and learn fundamental commands on command line
